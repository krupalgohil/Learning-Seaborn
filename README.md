# 📊 Learning Seaborn

Welcome to **Learning Seaborn** 🎨  
This repository contains my notes, code examples, and visualizations as I learn **Seaborn**, a powerful Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.  

---

## 📌 About Seaborn
Seaborn makes it easier to create beautiful, informative plots with just a few lines of code.  
It is especially useful for:
- Statistical plots
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Quick insights into datasets
- Better aesthetics than Matplotlib
